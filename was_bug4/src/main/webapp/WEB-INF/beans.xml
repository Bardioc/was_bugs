        <!--
         This is another bug in WebSphere which got resolved in OWB 2++ years ago
         It is actually even needed by the spec to enable an Interceptor for
         EACH and every BDA separately, like with Alternatives. Either you completely drop
         BDA like we did in OWB, or you implement it properly.
